## 📊 Data Storage

All data is stored in a single Excel file: **`tasks.xlsx`** (located in your Documents/TaskManager folder). This file contains the following six sheets:

1. **Tasks**
   - Stores the main task list, including task IDs, descriptions, status, timestamps (created, completed, paused), focus time, and other metadata.

2. **Sessions**
   - Logs all focus, break, pause, and application sessions with start/end times, session type, associated task IDs, and notes.

3. **WorkDays**
   - Tracks each work day, including start/end times, planned duration, active status, and a list of session logs for that day.

4. **Statistics**
   - Contains daily productivity metrics such as total focus time, break time, number of completed sessions, and productivity scores.

5. **Backups**
   - Maintains a log of backup operations, including backup timestamps and file paths for recovery purposes.

6. **Metadata**
   - Stores application-level metadata, version info, and configuration settings to ensure compatibility and smooth upgrades.

**Backup System:**  
- The application automatically creates timestamped backups of `tasks.xlsx` when you end a work day, complete focus sessions, or request a manual backup.  
- Backups are stored in the `Archive` subfolder for easy recovery.

**Note:**  
- You can open and analyze `tasks.xlsx` in Excel for advanced filtering, reporting, or sharing your productivity data.

## 🔄 Backup System

The application automatically creates backups when:
- Ending a work day
- Completing focus sessions
- Manual backup requests

Backups are stored with timestamps for easy recovery.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Excel file locked**: Close any open Excel files before running the application
2. **Notifications not working**: Ensure Windows notifications are enabled
3. **Sound not playing**: Check system volume and audio settings

### Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:
- Invalid commands show helpful error messages
- Data corruption triggers automatic recovery
- Network issues are handled gracefully
